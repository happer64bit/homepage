# Introducing Ginz: Simplify Cloning Multiple GitHub Repositories

Are you tired of manually cloning multiple GitHub repositories? Have you ever wished for a tool that could automate the process and save you time and effort? Look no further! I'd like to introduce Ginz, a powerful command-line tool designed to simplify the process of cloning multiple GitHub repositories based on a single configuration file.


## Why Ginz?

Cloning multiple repositories from GitHub can be a tedious and time-consuming task, especially when you need to clone repositories with different branches. Ginz aims to streamline this process by providing a convenient way to specify repositories and their branches in a configuration file. With Ginz, you can easily clone all your desired repositories with just a single command.


## Features of Ginz

### 1. Cloning Multiple Repositories

Ginz allows you to specify multiple repositories in a configuration file. Each repository entry includes the repository's URL and an optional branch name. Ginz reads this configuration file and clones each repository accordingly.

### 2. Branch Specification

Sometimes, you may need to clone repositories with specific branches. Ginz makes it easy to specify the branch for each repository in the configuration file. This way, you can ensure that you're working with the correct branches right from the start.

### 3. Progress Updates

When cloning multiple repositories, it's helpful to have visibility into the progress. Ginz provides progress updates during the cloning process, allowing you to track the status and estimated completion time.

### 4. Customization through Configuration

Ginz is highly customizable. You can configure the tool to suit your specific needs by editing the configuration file. Add or remove repositories, update branch names, and adapt Ginz to your workflow seamlessly.

## Getting Started with Ginz

To start using Ginz, follow these simple steps:

1. Install Python 3.x on your system if you haven't already.
2. Open a terminal or command prompt and install Ginz using the following command:

```shell
pip install -e git+https://github.com/happer64bit/ginz-cli#egg=ginz
```

3. Create a configuration file named `Ginz.toml` in the desired directory.
4. Add repository entries to the configuration file in the following format:

```toml
[repository-name]
source = "https://github.com/username/repository-name"
branch = "main"
```

Replace `[repository-name]` with a unique name for each repository, `source` with the GitHub repository URL, and `branch` with the desired branch name (optional, defaults to "main").

5. Navigate to the directory containing the `Ginz.toml` configuration file in your terminal or command prompt.
6. Run the following command to start the cloning process:

```shell
ginz
```

Ginz will read the configuration file, clone the specified repositories, and display progress updates as it progresses.

## Conclusion

Ginz simplifies the process of cloning multiple GitHub repositories. By automating the cloning process and providing progress updates, Ginz saves you time and effort, allowing you to focus on your development tasks. Give Ginz a try and experience the convenience of effortlessly cloning multiple repositories with ease!

Happy cloning with Ginz!
