I am currently a college student but as an developer and also teen, I find passionate about coding and programming. When it's come to my goal, it have to achieve them.

Learning Programming languages are not goal, they are tools that are used to solve problems.

## My Goals

I had myself declare some goals!

### Data Structure and Algorithms

Yes, DSA! Mastering data structures and algorithms is one of my top priorities. Not only are these essential for technical job interviews, but they are also incredibly useful for solving real-world problems in software development and building efficient systems.

### NeoVim (HELL YEAH)

I’ve been using VSCode for the past five years, and while it’s great, I’ve been inspired by people using NeoVim or Vim editors with incredible speed and efficiency. These editors are highly customizable—you can set key mappings to match your preferences, making coding faster.

### System Design

I enjoy diving deep into over-engineering projects, and system design fascinates me. Learning system design will help me understand how large-scale systems and tools work. This knowledge will be valuable for real-world projects, and it aligns with my long-term goal of becoming a system architect.

### Learning English

Yes, you heard that right. As a Burmese from Myanmar, I feel that my English skills are not yet where I want them to be. Since my dream is to work abroad and eventually earn a six-figure salary, improving my English proficiency is crucial. I want to communicate confidently and effectively in both personal and professional settings.
