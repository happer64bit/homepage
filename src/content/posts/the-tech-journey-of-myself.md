# The Tech Journey of Myself

I was born in Yangon, Shwe Pyi Thar, which is a bit crowdeder than other cities in Yangon (Rangoon). I am half Burmese and half Rakhine. *I am not proud of being half Rakhine*. Anyway, I have been using computers since I was young. I had always touched programming language since I was young, and it was VBS.

I had only faced one problem while writing my own VBScript, and it was file extension format. After the computer (PC) got sold, I got disconnected from the era of programming and technology.

I miss these days. I was using an alert box with a fake hacked message in VBScript.

After years, I got the idea to create a Minecraft software-free download website. As it was a website, I needed to learn website development, and I downloaded an application for learning website development. I was happy with my working code.

When the COVID-19 came and the cutdown on internet access, I got W3Schools offline version downloaded on my phone, and I learned HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

I was a slow learner compared to other people because I had to learn by myself. I don't know things like Docker, GitHub Actions, MVC, Database, and such things like these. But I had to find out what these were by myself. Also, I don't understand what is `def` in Python, but I figured that out while taking a shower.

I hate **Java** due to its OOP language design. I love using Python, TypeScript, and JavaScript. I also love Golang due to its performance. I am dreamed to be a full-stack developer.

I also learned React, then I tried to learn Vue.JS, but I failed. And I found Next.JS, a lovely SSR framework. *I don't like the performance*. However, I am still using it for some of my web apps. *This site was not built using Next.JS; it was built using Astro.JS.*

In conclusion, I have faced a lot of problems, but I don't give up.
