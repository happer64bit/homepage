# Server-Side Rendering (SSR)

Server-side rendering is a cool web development trick where the server creates the whole webpage and sends it to your browser. Unlike when your browser does all the work in client-side rendering, here, the server does the heavy lifting, sending a complete webpage for a smoother, faster user experience.

## Pros

- SEO-Friendly: SSR helps improve search engine optimization as search engines can easily crawl and index content from server-rendered pages.
- Improved Initial Load Time: Users experience faster initial page loads because the server sends a fully rendered HTML page, reducing the need for client-side rendering.
- Social Media Sharing: When users share links on social media, the shared content is already present in the HTML, ensuring a rich preview without requiring additional client-side rendering.
- Accessibility: SSR provides better support for users with disabilities or slower network connections, as the server delivers a fully formed page.

## Cons

- Server Load: Server-side rendering can put more load on the server compared to client-side rendering, especially in scenarios with a high volume of requests.
- Complexity: Implementing SSR can be more complex than client-side rendering, requiring additional server-side logic and infrastructure.
- Limited Interactivity: Initial page loads may be faster, but subsequent interactions might still require client-side rendering, impacting the overall user experience.
