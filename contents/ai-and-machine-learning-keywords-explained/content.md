# Ai and Machine Learning Keywords Explained

## Keywords

- **Model:** A process, based on data to make predictions or decisions about new data.
- **Dataset**: A collection of data points used for training, testing, or validating a machine learning model, containing features or attributes that describe each data point along with the target values or labels to be predicted.
- **Training Data:** The dataset is used to train a machine learning model.
- **Epoch:** During each epoch, the model sees the entire dataset, learns from it, and updates its parameters (weights and biases) to minimize the loss function.
- **Loss:** Machine learning models minimize loss functions (quantifying prediction error) to achieve better alignment between predictions and actual values.
- **Weight:** Weights in neural networks are like dials, determining the influence of one neuron on another.
- **Bias:** In neural networks, bias is a constant value added to a neuron's input, allowing it to shift the activation function and influence the output independently of the weighted inputs.
- **Gradient Descent**: An optimization algorithm used to minimize the loss function by adjusting the model's parameters in the direction of the steepest descent of the loss surface.
- **Input Layer**: The input layer is the first layer of a neural network where the raw input data is fed into the model. Each neuron in the input layer represents a feature or attribute of the input data. The number of neurons in the input layer is determined by the number of input features.
- **Hidden Layer**: Intermediate layers in a neural network that process input data through weighted connections and activation functions, providing the capacity for the network to learn complex patterns.
- **Output Layer**: The final layer of a neural network that produces the model's predictions or outputs, with the number of neurons and the activation function depending on the specific task being performed.
