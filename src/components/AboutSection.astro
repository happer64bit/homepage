          I grew up in Shwe Pyi Thar, Yangon—and that shaped how I see
          everything. Nothing was handed to me, so I learned early how to rely
          on myself. I respect where I came from: the struggle, the people, the
          rhythm of life. 
        </p>
        
        <p>
          But I never let it decide how far I can go. I move
          forward carrying discipline from the past and ambition for the future.
          Every skill I build, every late night I grind, is proof that my
          starting point doesn't define my destination.
