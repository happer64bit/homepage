# What is a JavaScript Framework?
A JavaScript framework is a collection of pre-written code that offers opinions about how software should be built. A framework usually provides a set of tools, components, and conventions that help developers create web applications faster and more consistently. A framework can also handle common tasks such as routing, state management, data fetching, testing, and deployment.
