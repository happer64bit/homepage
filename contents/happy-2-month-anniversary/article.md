<div style="text-align: right">To My Honey <b>Thae Su Moe</b></div>

Having you as my partner is one of the luckiest things that has ever happened to me in my entire life. Since you entered my life, everything has started to change, and I cherish every moment we spend together. Talking to you always brings a smile to my face.

I love you more than ever. You are my first love, and I am yearning to have you as my future wife. I don't care about what people say, blame, or disappoint about us. I don't care about money or whatever you looks like. I just love you.

I love you for your kindness, your laughter that brightens my darkest days, and the way you make me feel like the luckiest person in the world. I can't wait to build a life together, to create memories, and to face the future hand in hand.

No matter the challenges that lie ahead, I know that our love will always be stronger. You mean the world to me, and I cherish every moment we spend together. I look forward to a lifetime of love and happiness with you.
